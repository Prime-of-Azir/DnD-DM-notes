## The place
- 20 slumping hovels of clay, dried hay and bent stick 
- centered on a sun-baked brick square and a muddy well.
- Fields of turnips and black squash
- Have 68 sp of valuables to steal - 2 sp coins, 20 sp of tools, pans & livestock (6 chickes, 5 goats) and 44 sp of knick knacks (mstly turnip wine & 100s of pounds of root vegetables)
- If razed, huts rebuilt in a few weeks and, once new turnip wine is made, life will return to depressing normal
## The people
- Scruffy, soiled, sickly people
- Lots of drinking of mulchy turnip wine
- Spend their days in the fields and the nights clustered around the largest hut, drinking and looking for a fight.
## The Government
- No leadership or military
- They will defend themselves if attacked, 46 farmers strong armed with felling axes and pitchforks.
- All that can be mustered is 1d6 furious drunks outraged for a breach of non-existent community morals
