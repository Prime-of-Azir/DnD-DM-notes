### A7: Grotto
- Outdoor lighting
- Encounters: 1d6/2+1 cavort in the sun. A8 phantasms will join after 1 round of combat.
- Grotto covered by carved crown with a bleached set of **frescos**
	- Interior wall & ceiling are densely painted with scowling, bearded & beaked faces, half patriarch/half bird of prey. Eyes of the stern judges is hacked away with words written in tall, dark brown letters.
		- "I DO NOT KNEEL OR BOW"
### A8: Pumpkin patch
- Outdoor lighting
- Encounters
	- During day, 2d6 phantasms basking in the sunlight like sunning lizards. 
	- During night, 2 in 6 of the hated pretender hungrily staring at pumpkin. 1 in 6 that he's in pensive mood (+2 reaction roll), thinking of world beyond prison, a resinous tear in his eye. If not encountered yet, guaranteed to be here.
- Half-roofed & pleasantly filled with sunlight/moonlight. In the centre is a fat, orange **pumpkin** in a tub. At the corners, there is **broken furniture**.
	- Pumpkin in a tub with a slip-gaze of birds pecking a crowned skull. Around the tub, there is a **circle of glyphs**.
		- The glyphs are copies of the A2 circle written in dried blood. They don't seem to have any power though.
		- Damaging the pumpkin throws him into a screeching rage. (ML 12, attacks on sight)
		- If they do not disturb the pumpkin, +2 reaction roll (does not stack with pensive mood)
	- The broken furniture is piles of splintered & time-greyed wood, once ornately carved. Close examination reveals many small animal bones & golden fittings & screws (40 gp).
### A9: battlements
- Outdoor lighting
- A carved oval patio exposed to the open sky, at its centre lies a **spherical machine**. At its sides, a pair of worn stone benches carved like an opulent, cushioned chair & a lounging chair.
	- A sphere as tall as a human, made of intermeshing gears, discs & bands of bronze, brass & other metals mounted on a heavy bronze framework. Too big/complex/fragile to dismantle/transport.
	- The various components have **spheres** irregularly welded to them in a strangely familiar pattern with arcane glyphs. They seem easy to move around.
		- If someone that knows astronomy/astrology, the spheres are stars and planets arranged in a horribly out-of-date pattern.
		- Arrange the spheres to the current day & person that arranged them will be given a prophetic vision. Will need 10 years to recharge for another working.
		- Arrange the stars like star mural (A10) & phantasms are dispelled.
- Around the patio, on the back of the rear battlements, are powerful sigils. They repel the phantasms & the pretender, making them uncomfortable.
